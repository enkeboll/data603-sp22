<h1 align="center">Benefits of Big Data Curation</h1>
 
Big Data is defined as “high volume, high velocity, and high variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization.” As a result we need to use tools which will consider the factors of big data and will improve decision making and reduce operational inefficiencies. Considering the amount of data being generated rapidly a significant portion of Big Data’s success will depend upon content curation. For the research paper I want to focus on three major factors. 
1. What is data curation and why is it necessary? 
2. Common steps involved in data curation process (Lifecycle) 
3. Demostration of curated and non curated data analysis. 

I also want to explore AI based data curation tools which are currently available. I am planning to explain the topic with the help of case study. I found one research paper Big Data Curation which I will be referring for explaining theoretical content.
