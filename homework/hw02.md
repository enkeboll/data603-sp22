## NoSQL Database

NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases which store and retrieve data differently than relational tables. . NoSQL database option provides easy accessibility to largely unstructured data over DBMS.

### NoSQL Database Models

### 1. Key-value Databases
These databases store and manage data using a dictionary consisting of key value pairs in which a key serves as a unique identifier to retrieve values. Examples: Redis, Memcached, Riak.

### 2. Columnar Databases
Columnar databases use columns to store the data but rather than creating tables as RDB it stores each column in files. Examples : Apache Cassandra.

### 3. Document-oriented Databases
Document oriented databases store key and document pairs. Where key acts as an identifier and documents store the data. Examples : MongoDB, Couchbase, Apache.


### 4. Graph Databases
These databases are a subcategory of documents databases. Nodes represent the elements and connections between elements are shown by edges. These databases are commonly used in cases where itâ€™s important to be able to gain insights from the relationships between data points. Examples : Neo4j, ArangoDB, OrientDB


## Data Lake

A data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed for analytics applications. It differs from traditional data warehouses where data was stored in hierarchical manner and schemas were applied on the data before storing it into the warehouses.

### Advantages :
- Highly durable and low cost
- Open format data storage
- Usability for advanced analytics and machine learning
- Stores raw data in a multiple formatas

### Challenges :
- Reliability issues
- Slow performance
- Lack of security features

Bringing the data management and governance layer from the warehouse architecture will leverage the quality, reliability and security for streaming and batch operation.
